# RandomWalk_Visualization
Develop a RandomWalk plot in either 2d or 3d, with arbitrary number of Agents, steps and moves allowed per step.

once downloaded, go into its directory, and you may try it out with:
py RandomWalk.py <number of Points/Agents> <number of turns/moves> <number of steps allowed for each move> <dimensions of the plot>

for example:
py RandomWalk.py 10 50 2 2
